A discrete event **Blockchain Simulator**.

Initially written to simulate Ethereum. However, with a goal to be used as tool to simulate any blockchain.

Abstract
--------

*Blockchain systems have received an outburst of interest both in research and industry.
Blockchains are distributed ledgers where different participants, who do not fully trust each other, agree on a global state of the ledger.
The rapid expansion of contributions to this field only makes it more important, and challenging, to understand the possibilities of this technology.
However, there is a lack of tools to evaluate design and implementation decisions.
To address this issue, this project aims to provide a simulation tool flexible enough to evaluate different blockchain implementations, which can be rapidly implemented by extending existing simulation models.
The simulator is then used to create a simulation of Ethereum network, and to compare the results with measurements taken from the network.
A Ethereum simulation model offers the possibility to change environment conditions and answer different questions or perform a evaluation of the system.
This process can be applied in any blockchain system.*
